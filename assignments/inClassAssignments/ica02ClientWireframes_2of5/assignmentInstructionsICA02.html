  <p>Create the homepage for a flower shop.</p>
  <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
  <p>Wireframes are used to show team members and clients what an
  application or website will look like. You are determining where
  elements will be placed and identifying the CTA (Call to Action)
  on a page. They are also great for testing your designs to see if
  people can use the product you have designed. Knowing how to
  quickly develop and change a wireframe is key to developing a
  good user experience.</p>

  <p>For Part Two of this exercise, you will be creating a
