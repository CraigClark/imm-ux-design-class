# Changes for next year

## All assignments

### Purpose

Add a section that describes the purpose of the assignments. For example, on the feedback assignment, students are writing about what they think is good or not good about a design. The purpose is about providing evidenced based feedback, and objectively evaluating feedback bt identifying what type it is and using evidence to determine if you would implement the recommending or not.

### Colour choices

On written assignments, ask for a paragraph explaining colour choices. The explanation should be based on what we did in colour theory class. Emotion of colour and colour scheme.

In the colour swatches, how will colours be used.

### Thumbnails

Specify a minimum number of thumbnails

### Increase range of rubric

- Check all rubrics and have an extra grade column for outstanding work, this is to solve issue where students technically meet the requirements of the assignment, but work is not professional looking. Make it clear that this column has to do with exceeding expectations.

### Add to rubric a row for assignment submission

- has OCN
- properly named
- proper format
- submitted as instructed
- links work
- professor has proper permissions on shared files

### Create figma teams for students

Instead of having students create their own teams, do it myself to prevent access issues.

### Add tips and tricks, probably videos

- how to fit a large image on a 8.5x11 (particilarily for wierframe)

## ica03 logo

- on rubric, add a grade 3, something between minimal and very good
- change grade so typogrophy isn't the heaviest weighted grade, currently it's worth 6

## Feedback Exercise

- Rename to _Prorotype critique_ so it aligns with terminology used in the lesson
- Specifically state in the instructions to identify thy type of feedback you have received

### new requirements

- When providing feedback, use evidence based on what we have learned.  
  ie. Instead of "your headings should have the same alignment" write "To follow the principal of repetition, all you headings should have the same alignment. I recommend aligning to the left to follow the principals of Gutenberg readability.

## Make some guides

### Basic typography

- 5 rules of typography or something lime that.
  - alignment
  - caps
  - line length
- What should be in a typography swatch
- don't use images of text

## A01 wireframe

- do it in figma
- show class how to use grids and layout columns, grade on this

## A02 redesign

- Something between 10 and 5 in rubric for students close, but not there/ This resolves issue where a student who misses 80% of details gets the same mark in rubric as student missung 10% of details
- Break the rubric down so each section of the requlrements, primary content, secondary content etc is reflected in the rubric. ie. points for primary - its there, it's labeled
- add criteria/rubric all conent on mobile is reflected on desktop
- improve sample client description to include audience etc. so it matches the requirements

## A02 pre-assignment

Make this have a grade value so students submit on time

## A03

Fir intereraction, have them describe it in text. In some cases, I cannot find the interaction.

Find a way to make the relationship between a design system and components more obvious
