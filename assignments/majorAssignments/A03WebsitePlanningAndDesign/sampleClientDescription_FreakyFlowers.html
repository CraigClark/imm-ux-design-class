    <h1>Client description: Flower Freaks</h1>
    <p>
      Partners Lin and Noah started flower Freaks in the summer of 1970, one
      year after they met at the Woodstock music festival. The shop is a local
      flower shop in Rockland Ontario. On their retirement, Lin and Noahâ€™s
      daughters Sarah took over operations. Sarah noticed that a lot of clients
      are interested in growing, not just purchasing bouquets of cut flowers.
      She started an Instagram account where she talked about how to grow
      flowers, species of flowers, edible and medicinal flowers. Quickly she had
      hundreds of thousands of followers. This increased after Covid hit. Many
      people were no longer sending flowers to others, but they were growing
      their own a lot more. Sarah shifted the focus of Flower Freaks to a place
      where people could buy equipment, seeds and attend classes related to the
      growing, care and use of flowers. Sarah plans to sell online and hire a
      service to look after shipping for her. People can pay to take online
      classes from Sarah and the other staff. While you can still order cut
      flowers from Flower Freaks, it is no longer the primary focus of the
      company.

      Flower Freaks currently has a website, it is used to order cut flowers.
      There is a strong social media presence, particularly on Instagram.

    <h2>Decisions on the <em>Client descriotion</em> section</h2>
    <p>
      I made up everything about Freaky Flowers based on what I thought would be
      a fun flower store. I know there are people who really love flowers, and
      are into growing their own. I thought it would be interesting to have a
      flower shop that went beyond selling cut flowers for decoration and
      celebration.

    <p>
      I chose to include the history because it sets the tone of the company.
      The change in the business direction gives me a focus to work with. I have
      an idea what the audience is interested in, but not who they are.
    </p>

    <p>
      Information about the client and audience should dictate everything you do
      on the project.
