# Changes to make for Winter 2025

## ICA01 Thumbnail

- add requirement to have a paragraph about the flower shop. This is to see if future work is client suitable. Maybe call it a 'brand brief'

## ICA03 Client branding

- Add criteria to include description from ICA02, use it to measure client suitability
- Give more weight to colour than typography

## A01

- more weight for colour than typography in grades
- add criteria/rubric to capture colour descripion and choices
- clarify using the frame type, nit just side. ie phone preview shows phone frame, same for desktop
- make it cleare that they should be describing the Libraries priiorities in the description
- for descriptive info, add to rubric for lowest score that either some things are not described or are not adequately described.

## A03

This whole rubric needs a re-work to differentiate between meeting criteria and exceptional work



For interactions, something between 4 and 8 when they have interactions, but are not very interesting. Like a button hover



on ribric for logo, something between lacks creativity and excellent. We need a 'meets criteria here.

Fix levels on rubric, exceeds expectations etc

Psychology, something about psychology being suitable for what the user needs and the client hopes to accomplish

more focus on colour and text styles in the design systyem

- maybe 'atomic design principals applied to design system and components'

- break ujp design system into typography, colour and elements
