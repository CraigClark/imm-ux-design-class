# Changes to make for Winter 2025

## ICA01 Thumbnail

- add requirement to have a paragraph about the flower shop. This is to see if future work is client suitable. Maybe call it a 'brand brief'

## ICA03 Client branding

- Add criteria to include description from ICA02, use it to measure client suitability
- Give more weight to colour than typography

## A01
- more weight for colour than typography in grades
- add criteria/rubric to capture colour descripion and choices
- clarify using the frame type, nit just side. ie phone preview shows phone frame, same for desktop
- make it cleare that they should be describing the Libraries priiorities in the description
- for descriptive info, add to rubric for lowest score that either some things are not described or are not adequately described.
