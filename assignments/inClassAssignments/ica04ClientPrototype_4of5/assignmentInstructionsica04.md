## Grading

6% of the final mark

## Purpose

Prototypes show how you plan to build a website, letting team members and clients interact with it as if it were real. You demonstrate how different parts and features work together, including how users will move through the site and use the CTAs (Call to Action). Prototypes are important for testing how easy the website is to use and improving the user experience before coding begins. Being able to create and update prototypes quickly is key to making sure the final product meets user needs.

## Details

For Part Four of this exercise, you will create a prototype in Figma that depicts the homepage for your flower shop client’s website.

*You will complete part 5 during the final UX in-class exercise.*

## Required

Your assignment should include:

- Artboard resolution: Choose the iPhone 14 Pro frame.
- Base your assignment on the wireframe you did for *ICA02 - client wireframes*
- Use the logo, typography, and color scheme you used for *ICA03 - client branding.*
- You must include the following sections:
  - Header
  - Navigation
  - Content
  - Footer
  - Images and text
  - Lorem Ipsum is fine for body text
  - Use actual words for headings
  - Use actual words for navigation items
  - Label your layers and frames in Figma
- You must include at least one complete interaction. It can be anything you want other than “*scroll to*”. Complete interaction means that the interaction has to have a start and a completion state. For example:
  - Hamburger menu: It can be opened and it can be closed
  - Accordion: It can be expanded and collapsed
  - Simulated animation: There is a way to get back to the initial state.
- Your interaction must use more than one screen.
- You cannot use a ‘*scroll to*’ as your interaction.

- Overall Layout & Design
