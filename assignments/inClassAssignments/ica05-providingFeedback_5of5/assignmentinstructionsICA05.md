## Title

Client Prototypes | Feedback and Evaluation (Part Five)

## Grading

6% of final mark

## Description

Evaluate feedback from the prototype created in ICA04.

## Details

For Part Five of this assignment, you will:

- Gather feedback on your prototype created in *ICA04 - client prototypes*
- Provide feedback to other students
- Evaluate feedback provided to you - Identify if the feedback is reaction, directed, or a critique

> **NOTE**: In the evaluation, make sure your opinions are evidence-based. Evidence comes from the things we have learned in class: Information hierarchy, design theory, accessibility, and web psychology.

*This is the final in-class exercise in this series*

## Required

- All feedback is to be comments on the Figma prototype.
- Prototypes must not be password protected.
- You must be logged into your Figma account to provide feedback.

**You will receive 0 (zero) marks for anonymous feedback.**

Your assignment should include:

- Two links to other students’ prototypes where you provided feedback
- Feedback from at least two people other than yourself
  - Each person should provide at least two comments
- A written evaluation on how and why you would or would not implement the feedback you gathered.

## Additional

You will also be graded on:

- Having a functioning published prototype
- The required amount of feedback
- Thoughtfulness of the feedback and evaluation. I will be looking for the reasoning behind your evaluation choices. Use evidence based on what we have learned in class. For example, what design principle supports your decision? What aspect of web psychology or accessibility?

## Submission

- Submit your assignment through Brightspace
- This is a text submission on Brightspace; use the comment field on Brightspace.
- No OCN is required for this assignment (the one you submitted for ICA04 is valid for your prototype)

### Additional Submission Information

- Test the links to the prototypes you commented on
- Make sure your prototype is not password protected

My expectation is that when I click a link in your assignment, I will be taken to the correct prototype and I will have access to view it.

## NOTES

### Providing Feedback

It is expected that you will cooperate with other students seeking feedback on prototypes.

If you have already evaluated more than 3 of your fellow students’ prototypes, it is acceptable to ask them to find another reviewer. That is up to you.

### Length of Written Submission

Please keep the evaluation under 500 words.
