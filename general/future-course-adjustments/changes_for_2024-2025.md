# Changes for 2024/2025

## Class ordering

Consider implications of doing User Centred Design class before the User research class

## Figma links

Remove all requirements from assignments for links to figma prototypes. This is because students often don't put assignments in the correct folder. If that's the only way I can see their work, it is a clear cut case of _I couldn't find it, I couldn't grade it_.

Add a note to all figma assignments that I will not grade assignments in the wrong location.

## Rubrics

### Speed up marking

See if there is way to have more yes/no type grading in rubrics while leaving room to consider quaslity of work.

### levels

Rubric levels are confusing. Maybe match them to letter grades?

Also, if a student has a grade below the lowest threshold, you can't properly publish grades without an error. See if they can be removed all togehter.

### Clarify descriptions

Make it clear that I need to know, specifically, how things are addressed. For example

> Changes are addressed. Principals of design theory and psychology learned in class are addressed.

Students are getting around this by saying things like "I applied crap principals" without explaining how and why.

## a01 client wireframe

Make sure students know what a public library is. Many are referring to 'the company' or adding things like 'buy now' buttons.

Make sure requirments in assignment description align with requirements in the rubric. They do now, but the ribric is more specific.

More emphasis on descriptive details. I would like to see a description of how each element will look. - Bring back descriptive info requirements

Make sure students know that they need to specfify what the CTA is. Callin a thing a CTA means nothing.

Get rid of explaining typography choices, but keep requirement to explain how fonts are used.

Remove requirement for link to prototype, these should be in the appropriate project shared with the students.

Use actual labels for navigation

## a02

Add correct number of pages to rubric, specify that the nav menu does not count as a page,

move layout and usability to prototype section of rubric and mobe a11y to the end.

## ica05 critique

copy critque to submission > its a pain navigating to figma
More weight on the critiques people make

A02

reorder rubric so layout and usability are in the prototype section

A03

Adjust Rubric so there is something between not meeting criteria and full marks. This will let students know they have met the criteria, and will reward students who put in extra effort.

Change rubric requirement descriptions to reflect quality of workm not so black and white. For example:

> Approach will miss some segments of the target audiences.

To

> Approach does not specify how information will be collected or the approach will miss some of the audience.

In Rubric, make accessibility more gradual, currently grande is 0,3 or full marks

make a not to students to not rename groups.
