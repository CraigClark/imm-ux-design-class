Website planning, design and evaluation

## Grading

20% of final mark

## Description

In groups, you will plan, build, and evaluate a prototype for a client’s website.

The groups and assigned clients are listed below.

## Details

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ has hired your team to design and develop a website and branding for their company. In order to create the optimum final product, you will research, develop a design system, and design prototypes for your client. You will also plan user testing of the prototype.

## Required

### Part 1: Website planning and evaluation

While there is a maximum word count for each section, it is not required to write paragraphs of text. If you can convey the information with tables, lists, charts, or infographics, that is acceptable.

#### Part 1, requirement 01 | Cover page

- Client name
- Project title
- Date submitted
- Client logo
- Your company name
- Team member names

#### Part 1, requirement 02 | Table of contents

Include all sections of your project with a title and page number. Each page of your assignment should have a page number.

Sections should be:

1. Client description
2. Understanding the audience
   1. Demographics
   2. Personas
3. Psychology
4. User research
5. Feedback

**NOTE**: Make sure the sections of your written assignment are in the same order shown here.

#### Part 1, requirement 03 | Client description (max 300 words)

- Who is the client?
- What do they do?
- Why do they do what they do?

- Where do they operate?
- How do they deliver their services?

There is an example client description attached.

#### Part 1, requirement 04 | Understanding the audience

_Refer to Class 12: User-centred design_

##### Demographics (max 350 words)

- How will you find out who the target audiences are?
- Characteristics of the primary and secondary target audiences: _Consider: age, language, commonalities, barriers, career, location, computer skill level_

##### Personas

You can use the persona form attached below or make your own.

- Develop one persona for a member of the primary audiences
- Develop one persona for a member of the secondary audience

#### Part 1, requirement 05 | Web psychology (max 300 words)

_Refer to:_

- _Class 06: Aspects of emotion_
- _Class 06: Social validation_
- _Class 06: Reciprocity_
- _Class 07: Cognitive load_
- _Class 07: Simplified choices_
- _Class 07: Scarcity_
- _Class 07: Gamification_

Write about the psychology approach you will take to the website. You will be graded on how well your choices meet the needs of the audience and the objectives of the client.

#### Part 1, requirement 06 | User research (max 500 words)

_Refer to:_

- _class 10: User research_
- _class 12: User centred design_

Write about how you would research user needs.

- How do you find out what needs to be built?
- How do you determine the best way to organize information?
- How do you find out if users can complete the desired Call To Action (CTA)?

#### Part 1, requirement 09 | Feedback

_Refer to Class 9: Critique and feedback_

Publish the prototype created in Part 2. Show your prototype to three individuals. They can be classmates, but they don’t have to be. Ask them to leave feedback on your work. It is fine if they comment directly on the prototype, but copy the comments to your assignment.

**TIP:** Copy the feedback text to your assignment. Screenshots are not accessible and are poor design.

Write about the feedback (max 350 words):

- Identify what types of feedback you have received: reaction, direction, or critique.
- Would you implement the feedback you gather on the next version of the prototype? Why or why not?

**Important!** When providing feedback, use evidence based on what we have learned.  
e.g., Instead of “headings should have the same alignment,” write “To follow the principle of repetition, all headings should have the same alignment. I recommend aligning to the left to follow the principles of Gutenberg readability.”

### Part 2: Design system and prototype in Figma

#### Part 2, requirement 1 | Design system

_Refer to:_

- _Class 13: Design systems_
- _Class 4: Elements of a logo_
- _Class 3 and 4: Design theory_

Build a design system in Figma for your client.

- Design a logo for your client and include it here
- Include all reusable elements, for example:
  - Typography: headings, paragraphs, emphasized text, summaries, captions, sub-headings, etc.
  - Colours: primary, secondary, neutral, as well as any variations you will use
  - Links: active, hover, visited, links for different purposes
  - Buttons: primary, secondary, default, hover state
  - Navigation: primary, secondary, footer, icons
  - Cards: all the variations, e.g., with and without images, with and without links, with and without headings or body text
  - Form elements and controls: checkboxes, radios, text fields, text areas, labels, select lists, etc.

Where necessary, include mobile and desktop versions of elements.

#### Part 2, requirement 2 | Functional prototype

_Refer to Classes 2, 5, 13: Prototyping_

Build a mobile and a desktop prototype of your website.

You must design a minimum of 5 pages:

1. The home page
2. One page must have a form on it. The form must include at least three different form elements and a way to submit the form.
3. Form submission confirmation (what happens after a user submits the form).
4. Other than the home page, the rest are your choice.
5. Besides the navigation, your prototype must include one at least other interaction of your choice. For the purposes of this assignment, _scroll to top_ is not acceptable as the only interaction.

##### Notes on the prototype

- 5 pages means 5 pages of a website. That works out to at least 10 pages total: 5 mobile, 5 desktop.
- For mobile, use the iPhone 14/15 Pro (393 x 852) frame.
- For desktop, use the MacBook Pro 16” (1728 x 1117) frame.
- Use a 12-column grid.
- You can use whatever interactions you like, other than _scroll to top_, but they need to be complete interactions. A complete interaction means there is a straightforward way to return to the initial state.
- Your prototype must be navigable. For example, there needs to be a way to get from the home page to your other pages and back again.
- Use actual words for headings, titles, labels, and navigation. Lorem ipsum is fine for body content. You can also use AI to generate body content, however make sure you cite it in the OCN and you comply with the Algonquin College [Artificial Intelligence & Academic Integrity](https://www.algonquincollege.com/academic-integrity/student-supports/artificial-intelligence-academic-integrity/) standard.
- For feedback, it’s fine to have people comment directly on the prototype. However, you need to copy the feedback to your assignment.

**Design system as components:** Use components from the design system in the prototypes.

### Additional

The following will also be evaluated:

- Creativity
- Overall presentation
- Overall detail of information
- Accessibility (_Refer to Class 9: Design for everyone_)
- Implementation of design theory (_Refer to Class 2: Design theory and Class 3: Colour theory_)

## Submission

Only one person from your group needs to submit the assignment. Everyone in your group will receive the same grade.

### Part 1: Website planning and evaluation

- Combine the written assignment, personas, and OCN into **ONE PDF**.
- Hand in the PDF of your assignment through Brightspace.
- Do not submit a `.zip` file.
- The Original Content Notice (OCN) should be the last page.
- The OCN need not have a page number on it and should not be included in the table of contents.
- Name the PDF `A03-Group-number-websitePlanningAndEvaluation.pdf`.

### Part 2: Figma design system and prototype

- Create your prototype in the Figma project created for your team.
- Call the project _A03 ClientName_.
- Include the links to your published Figma project in the Brightspace notes.
- Make sure your design system and prototype are separate pages. The expectation is:
  - A page for assets (optional)
  - A page for the design system (required)
  - A page for the mobile prototype (required)
  - A page for the desktop prototype (required)
