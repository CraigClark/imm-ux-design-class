# Changes for fall 2025

- go through all rubrics and break them down to true/false where ever possible.
- one item for rubric criteria. For example, in colour, it might say 'scheme identified and well described' thous could be two line items, one for the scheme, one for the description

## A01 Wireframe

- rethink this. Specific measurements are not necessary in an age when wireframes are made with tools such as Figma

## A02 website re-design

- in presentation part of rubric, add a grade item for meets criteria. Currently there is nothing between amazing and has problems.
- fix the overall score piece in the Rubric, it doesn't make sense right now. you need 149/150 to get excellent.
- On evaluating assignment in rubric, something for meets criteria and exceptional
