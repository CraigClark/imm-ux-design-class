### Figma terminology

#### Team

This is a group of people who work on projects together. In this class, you will have a team that includes yourself and the instructor.

#### Project

A project is a file you work on within your team. A team can have several projects. The education version of Figma gives you access to create design and Figjam files. Figjam is a whiteboard tool. We do not currently use it in this class, however you may find it useful for organizing your work.

#### Pages

Pages help you keep your project organized. For example, you might have separate pages for the mobile and desktop versions of your project.

#### Frames

Frames are the most basic building block of Figma. Think of a frame as the artboard you will be working on. Making multiple frames and connecting them together is how you will build prototypes.

## Introducing wireframes

Wireframes are stage 2 of the design process. They are a visual depiction and placement of the website’s elements and a written description of the visual elements.

- What are wireframes - Web structure basics
- Why you should use wireframes - Gets your components aligned and planned.
- How you should start - Jot down the visual and technical descriptions you have in mind and then use grid paper to sketch out your idea.

## After class

You will have the knowledge required to do basic layout in Figma.
