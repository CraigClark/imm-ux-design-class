## Description

You have been approached by a flower shop to design the homepage for their new website. The first thing you need to do is come up with design ideas. To do that, make thumbnails of the homepage.

## Purpose

Thumbnails are an important part of the design process. Students will learn how to capture ideas quickly and zero in on concepts that work.

## Details

### Client description

Write a one-paragraph client description for a fictitious flower shop. This description will guide the design process for your thumbnails, wireframes, branding guidelines, and Figma prototype. In your paragraph, be sure to include:

- **Shop name:** Give your flower shop a clear, memorable name.
- **Business size and reach:** Indicate whether it’s a small local boutique, a regional chain, a national company, or even a global brand.
- **Target audience:** Describe the primary customers the shop aims to serve. Are they everyday flower buyers, event planners, high-end clients, or budget-conscious shoppers?
- **Brand personality or vibe:** Explain the overall feeling you want the shop to convey—e.g., a luxurious and exclusive boutique, a cheerful and whimsical neighbourhood florist, or a formal supplier specializing in weddings and funerals.

### Thumbnails
