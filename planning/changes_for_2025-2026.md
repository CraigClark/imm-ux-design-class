# 2025-2026 changes

## ica01 wireframes

For the client description piece, include a template. Some students are writing garbage that looks like ad copy.

## A01 wireframes

Change order in requirements and rubric so the description is first after the title page

make level 3 in colour scheme 'scheme is not identified'

Add a grading tip ? when I grade, I look at each element on the page. I want to know everything about it. Border? padding? margin? background? colour? what is it?
