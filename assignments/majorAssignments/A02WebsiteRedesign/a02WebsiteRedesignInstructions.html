<p>Website Redesign</p>
<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>
  In previous classes and assignments, you learned about information hierarchy,
  design theory, web psychology and accessibility. This assignment evaluates
  your ability to apply knowledge learned in class to solve problems on an
  existing website.

<p>20% of final mark</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
  Redesign a website (at least three pages) to improve the user experience on
  the site. As part of the redesign, you will be updating your client’s brand
  with a new logo, typography and a colour scheme.
</p>
<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>
  Using what you have learned in class, you will work with a poorly designed
  website and recreate its homepage and two other inside pages to improve the
  user experience. Additionally, you will be creating a new brand identity.
</p>
<p>
  A list of websites that need to be redesigned has been put together by the
  professor. Sites to be redesigned will be randomly assigned. For this
  assignment, you will apply all you have learned in class:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>accessibility</li>
  <li>design theory</li>
  <li>colour theory</li>
  <li>web psychology</li>
  <li>information hierarchy</li>
  <li>creating an interactive prototype</li>
  <li>gathering constructive feedback</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    It is not necessary to duplicate the information structure of the existing
    site. Part of the evaluation is seeing how well you can re-organize content
    when needed.
