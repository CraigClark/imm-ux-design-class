# Assignment Grading

This is an overview of how I will grade your assignments.

## Submissions

When you submit assignments to Brightspace, all files must be combined into **one PDF document**. This includes the Original Content Notice (OCN), which should be the last page of your document.

Many assignments will be completed in Figma with the OCN and supporting documents being submitted to brightspace. I check the time stamp on the brightspace submission and the revision log on the Figma project. If either of these timestamps is past the assignment due date, the late policy applies.

    <em>Only Figma prototypes created within the project folder assigned to you by the professor will be graded.</em>

## Grading

To pass the assignment, you must meet all the assignment requirements. The **rubric** will help you understand what I expect for each assignment.

If you go beyond the basic requirements, you can earn higher grades. This course is designed so that each lesson builds on the previous one. To achieve a higher grade, I look for a deep understanding of the material, how well you apply concepts from earlier lessons, and the quality and creativity of your work.

- **Needs improvement (up to 60%)**  
  The assignment requirements are **not met**.

- **Meets criteria (60% to 80%)**  
  The assignment requirements are met in a **satisfactory** way.

- **Exceeds expectations (80% to 90%)**  
  The assignment requirements are met and **go beyond** what is expected.

- **Excellent (90% to 100%)**  
  The assignment requirements are met and the results are **outstanding**.

## Feedback

I encourage you to ask for feedback on your assignments. If you want to know how you could improve, or if you received a high grade and want to know why, please ask me!

You can ask in person after class, by email, or we can schedule a Zoom meeting if you prefer.

Remember, there is more to learning than just grades. If you want to know how you are doing in general, feel free to ask me anytime.

## Late Submissions

I usually grade assignments on **Saturday mornings** after they are due. I set aside this time so that you can receive feedback early and apply it to your next assignment. If you submit an assignment late, you may miss this grading window. I will still grade your work, but you may have to wait several days, as I will need to find additional time to assess it.
