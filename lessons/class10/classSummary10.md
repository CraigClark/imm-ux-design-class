### Lesson: Introduction to user research

User research is a critical part of any product development, from manufacturing to interior design. This class will focus on user research for websites and apps.

- What is user research?
- Why do we do user research?
- Who is user research for?
- When do we do user research?

This is an in-class activity. Students will conduct usability testing sessions with each other to experience user testing as a tester and as a participant. This is worth 10% of your final mark.

### In class activity: Card sorting

#### Description

Card sorting is important research for developing site information architecture. This exercise will introduce you to the key concepts of card sorting.

#### Details

The class will break-out into three groups. Each group will choose a presenter who will share their screen.
