  <h4 id="part-1-requirement-09-feedback">Part 1, requirement 09 |
  Feedback</h4>
  <p><em>Refer to Class 9: Critique and feedback</em></p>
  <p>Publish the prototype created in Part 2. Show your prototype
  to three individuals. They can be classmates, but they don’t have
  to be. Ask them to leave feedback on your work. It is fine if
  they comment directly on the prototype, but copy the comments to
  your assignment.</p>
  <p><strong>TIP:</strong> Copy the feedback text to your
  assignment. Screenshots are not accessible and are poor
  design.</p>
  <p>Write about the feedback (max 350 words):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify what types of feedback you have received:
    reaction, direction, or critique.</li>
    <li>Would you implement the feedback you gather on the next
    version of the prototype? Why or why not?</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Important!</strong> When providing feedback, use
  evidence based on what we have learned.<br>
  e.g., Instead of “headings should have the same alignment,” write
  “To follow the principle of repetition, all headings should have
  the same alignment. I recommend aligning to the left to follow
  the principles of Gutenberg readability.”</p>

  <h4 id="part-2-requirement-2-functional-prototype">Part 2,
  requirement 2 | Functional prototype</h4>
  <p><em>Refer to Classes 2, 5, 13: Prototyping</em></p>
  <p>Build a mobile and a desktop prototype of your website.</p>
  <p>You must design a minimum of 5 pages:</p>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>The home page</li>
    <li>One page must have a form on it. The form must include at
    least three different form elements and a way to submit the
    form.</li>
    <li>Form submission confirmation (what happens after a user
    submits the form).</li>
    <li>Other than the home page, the rest are your choice.</li>
    <li>Besides the navigation, your prototype must include one at
    least other interaction of your choice. For the purposes of
    this assignment, <em>scroll to top</em> is not acceptable as
    the only interaction.</li>
  </ol>
  <h5 id="notes-on-the-prototype">Notes on the prototype</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>5 pages means 5 pages of a website. That works out to at
    least 10 pages total: 5 mobile, 5 desktop.</li>
    <li>For mobile, use the iPhone 14/15 Pro (393 x 852)
    frame.</li>
    <li>For desktop, use the MacBook Pro 16” (1728 x 1117)
    frame.</li>
    <li>Use a 12-column grid.</li>
    <li>You can use whatever interactions you like, other than
    <em>scroll to top</em>, but they need to be complete
    interactions. A complete interaction means there is a
    straightforward way to return to the initial state.</li>
    <li>Your prototype must be navigable. For example, there needs
    to be a way to get from the home page to your other pages and
    back again.</li>
    <li>Use actual words for headings, titles, labels, and
    navigation. Lorem ipsum is fine for body content. You can also
    use AI to generate body content, however make sure you cite it
    in the OCN and you comply with the Algonquin College <a href=
    "https://www.algonquincollege.com/academic-integrity/student-supports/artificial-intelligence-academic-integrity/">
      Artificial Intelligence & Academic Integrity</a> standard.
    </li>
    <li>For feedback, it’s fine to have people comment directly on
    the prototype. However, you need to copy the feedback to your
    assignment.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Design system as components:</strong> Use components
  from the design system in the prototypes.</p>
