  <p>Client Prototypes | Feedback and Evaluation (Part Five)</p>
  <h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
  <p>6% of final mark</p>
  <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
  <p>Evaluate feedback from the prototype created in ICA04.</p>
  <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
  <p>For Part Five of this assignment, you will:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Gather feedback on your prototype created in <em>ica04 -
    client prototypes</em></li>
    <li>Provide feedback to other students</li>
    <li>Evaluate feedback provided to you - Identify if the
    feedback is reaction, directed or a critique</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: In the evaluation, make sure your
    opinions are evidence based. Evidence comes from the things we
    have learned in class. Information hierarchy, design theory,
    accessibility and web psychology.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em>This is the final in-class exercise in this
  series</em></p>
  <h2 id="required">Required</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All feedback is to be comments on the Figma prototype.</li>
    <li>Prototypes must not be password protected.</li>
    <li>You must be logged into your Figma account to provide
    feedback.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>You will receive 0 (zero) marks for anonymous
  feedback.</strong></p>
  <p>Your assignment should include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A functioning link to your published prototype</li>
    <li>Two links to other students’ prototypes where you provided
    feedback</li>
    <li>Feedback from at least two people other than yourself
      <ul>
        <li>Each person should provide at least two comments</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>A written evaluation on how and why you would or would not
    implement the feedback you gathered.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="additional">Additional</h2>
  <p>You will also be graded on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>having a functioning published prototype</li>
    <li>The required amount of feedback</li>
    <li>thoughtfulness of the feedback and evaluation, I will be
    looking for the reasoning behind your evaluation choices. Use
    evidence based on what we have learned in class. For example,
    what design principal supports your decision? What aspect of
    web psychology or accessibility.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Submit your assignment through Brightspace</li>
    <li>This is a text submission on Brightspace, use the comment
    field on Brightspace</li>
    <li>No OCN is required for this assignment. (the one you
    submitted for ica04 is valid for your prototype)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="additional-submission-information">Additional submission
  information</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Test the link to your prototype</li>
    <li>Test the links to the prototypes you commented on</li>
    <li>Make sure your prototype is not password protected</li>
  </ul>
  <p>My expectation is that when I click a link in your assignment,
  I will be taken to the correct prototype and I will have access
  to view it.</p>
  <h2 id="notes">NOTES</h2>
  <h3 id="providing-feedback">Providing Feedback</h3>
  <p>It is expected that you will cooperate with other students
  seeking feedback on prototypes.</p>
  <p>If You have already evaluated more than 3 of your fellow
  students’ prototype, it is acceptable to ask them to find another
  reviewer. That is up to you.</p>
  <h3 id="length-of-written-submission">Length of written
  Submission</h3>
  <p>Please keep the evaluation under 500 words.</p>
  <hr>
  <h3 id="format">Format</h3>
  <p>Your assignment should look like this:</p>
  <p>Link to my prototype<br>
  <a href="https://example.com/my-prototype" class=
  "uri">https://example.com/my-prototype</a></p>
  <p>Links to prototypes that I commented on:<br>
  <a href="https://example.com/classmate-1-prototype" class=
  "uri">https://example.com/classmate-1-prototype</a><br>
  <a href="https://example.com/classmate-2-prototype" class=
